## Why testing anyway?

> “Why do we test? We test to develop a comprehensive understanding of the product and the risks
> around it. We test to find problems that threaten the value of the product, or that threaten the
> on-time, successful completion of any kind of development work. We test to help the business,
> managers, and developers decide whether the product they’ve got is the product they want.
> Above all, we test because it is the responsible thing to do. We have a duty of care toward our
> teams, our organizations, our customers, and society itself. Releasing poorly tested software
> would be a breach of that duty.”
