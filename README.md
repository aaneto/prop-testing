# Property Based Testing

This is the base repository for an upcoming presentation on property based testing on a weekly dev presentation @ Smarttbot (Fintech Company).

## Guideline

The presentation will follow this structure:

- Purpose of testing
- Classification of testing techniques
- What is property based testing even
- Presentation examples without code
- Demo using repository code

The content used to present those topics can be found at the presentations folder.
